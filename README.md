## Pre-Requisites
- (If you're using the source code) Python 3

## Installation & Setup

### From Release
1. Download the Windows or Linux release.
2. Put the program wherever you like, preferably somewhere that's easy to get to in your terminal. The program doesn't need to interact with any files, so it's fully portable and can live anywhere. For Windows users, I'd recommend `C:/Users/user` because it's not uncommon for software and CMD will probably start there.

### From Source
1. Clone or download this repository and do what you wish with the code.
2. To build, run either `build-Windows` or `build-Linux`.
3. Move the `/release` contents to wherever you like.

## How to Use
Run the program from a terminal. Say encrypt or decrypt, then your text, then your key.

### Encrypting
`basilisk.exe encrypt text key`  

### Decrypting
`basilisk.exe decrypt text key` 

It is recommended to use a phrase wrapped in quotes as opposed to a single word for your key.
